description: >
     The release checklist is the document that outlines the steps and tasks that
     need to be completed before a software release.
     It serves as a guide for the development team to ensure that all necessary tasks
     are completed and all necessary stakeholders are informed before the release is made.
     The checklist typically includes tasks related to code review, testing, documentation, and communication.
     By using a release checklist, teams can ensure that releases are smooth, efficient, and successful.

     # Release Process

     - [ ] Change the version in __init__.py and setup.py

          ```bash
          export VERSION=0.0.0
          ```

     - [ ] Commit these changes with the message: "Release: VERSION"

          ```bash
          git commit -m "Release: ${VERSION}"
          ```

     - [ ] Add a tag in git to mark the release:

          ```bash
          "git tag VERSION -m 'Adds tag VERSION for pypi'
          ```

     - [ ] Push the tag to git

          ```bash
          git push --tags origin main
          ```

     - [ ] Run the following commands in the top-level directory:

          ```bash
          python setup.py bdist_wheel
          python setup.py sdist
          ```

     - [ ] Upload the package to the pypi __test__ server __first__:

          ```bash
          twine upload dist/* -r pypitest
          twine upload dist/* -r pypitest --repository-url=https://test.pypi.org/legacy/
          ```

     - [ ] Check that you can install it in a virtualenv by running:

          ```bash
          pip install -i https://testpypi.python.org/pypi trlx
          trlx env
          trlx test
          ```

     - [ ] Upload the final version to actual pypi:

          ```bash
          twine upload dist/* -r pypi
          ```

     - [ ] Add release notes to the tag in github

          ```markdown
          # [0.0.0](https://github.com/CarperAI/trlx/compare/v0.0.0...v0.0.1) (2023-01-01)
