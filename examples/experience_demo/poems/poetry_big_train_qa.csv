As they do now at me."

To hide their myriad faces from my sight.
They threat in vain; the whirlwind cannot awe
A happy snow-flake dancing in the flaw."
SIR WALTER RALEGH,As You Came from the Holy Land (attributed),Renaissance,Love,"He is blind, he is deaf when he list,

WILLIAM BYRD,Care for Thy Soul as Thing of Greatest Price,Renaissance,Nature,"Care so, I say, the flesh to feed and clothe

Seek not to oppress the weak by wrongful might;"
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE,The Phoenix and the Turtle,Renaissance,Mythology & Folklore,"Co-supremes and stars of love,

Took a fat living from the Papacy"""
