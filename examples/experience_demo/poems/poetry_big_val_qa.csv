A mute, nearly beautiful thing
Is your face, that fills me with shame
As I see it hardening;"
D. H. LAWRENCE,Tortoise Shout,Modern,Love,"Giving up the ghost,
Or screaming in Pentecost, receiving the ghost.
His scream, and his moment's subsidence,
The moment of eternal silence,
Yet unreleased, and after the moment, the sudden, startling jerk of coition, and at once"
HART CRANE,from The Bridge: Quaker Hill,Modern,Nature,"That patience that is armour and that shields
Love from despairwhen love forsees the end
Leaf after autumnal leaf
                                    break off,
                                                   descend"
